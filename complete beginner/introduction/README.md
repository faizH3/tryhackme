- #### Offensive Security

The first large area within Cyber Security is the offensive side. This area involves attacking different applications and technologies to discover vulnerabilities.

This career is for you if:

you enjoy understanding how things work
you are analytical
you like thinking out of the box
The most common offensive security job role is a penetration tester. A penetration tester is an individual that is legally employed by an organisation to find vulnerabilities in their products. A penetration tester usually requires a broad range of knowledge including:

web application security
network security
use of programming languages to write various scripts
More recently, cloud security has also been gaining popularity as various organisations are now shifting their infrastructure to cloud providers such as AWS and Azure.

It's also possible to have a speciality in one of these topics, however a broad knowledge is the best way to start out.

To help you build this broad knowledge set, we have a beginner pathway that covers the aforementioned areas. Alternatively, you can go to the Hacktivities page and search for various topics (either by broad technologies such as web/network or specific keywords if you're familiar with certain attacks and techniques that you want to learn).
