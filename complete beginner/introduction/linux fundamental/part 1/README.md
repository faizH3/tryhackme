- ## Introduction
---

Welcome to the first part of the "Linux Fundamentals" room series. You're most likely using a Windows or Mac machine, both are different in visual design and how they operate. Just like Windows, iOS and MacOS, Linux is just another operating system and one of the most popular in the world powering smart cars, android devices, supercomputers, home appliances, enterprise servers, and more.

We'll be covering some of the history behind Linux and then eventually starting your journey of being a Linux-wizard! This room will have you:

>- Running your very first commands in an interactive Linux machine in your browser
>- Teaching you some essential commands used to interact with the file system
>- Introduce you to how users and groups work on Linux (and what this means for us as penetration testers)

`Where is Linux Used?`

It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things such as:

>- Websites that you visit
>- Car entertainment/control panels
>- Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
>- Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors

`Flavours of Linux`

The name "Linux" is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system). Thanks to UNIX being open-source, variants of Linux comes in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for.

For example, Ubuntu & Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. I.e. you can run Ubuntu as a server (such as websites & web applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop. For this series, we're going to be using Ubuntu.

> Ubuntu Server can run on systems with only 512MB of RAM

Similar to how you have different versions Windows (7, 8 and 10), there are many different versions/distributions of Linux.

Research: What year was the first release of a Linux operating system?
